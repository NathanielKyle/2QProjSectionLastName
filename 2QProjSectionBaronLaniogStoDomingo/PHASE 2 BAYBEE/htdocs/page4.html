            <h5>-Michael Craig Sing, Convicted Murderer</h5>
            <p id="start">Freak accidents, Deaths, and many more, This is Pisay After Nightfall... </p>
            <img class="craig" src="../public/images/craig.png" />
            <p>Michael Craig Sing, a Batch 2027 Grade 9-Neon student, was a particularly normal scholar. He has normal grades, and struggled with Filipino just like other scholars. However, there was one thing that sets him aside from other people...</p>
            <p> He was a registered assassin...</p>

            <p>One day, Sing was given an offer, 300 pesos and free co-op gulaman for a year if he can kill a man named Chopsquad Calporto. He then spent 2 days making a trap to capture him. It had to be hidden by everyone, but also simple. That was then when he decided to make it out of chairs and gravity.</p>

            <p>July 21 2022, It was finally the day. Craig went back to the trap, made sure it worked, and at 11:00am in the morning, Calporto went to the trap and got crushed by a million chairs. </p>

            <p style="text-align:center"> Craig had claimed his first victim.</p>
            <img class="rip" src="../public/images/ripbozo.jpeg" />
            <p>He had been given the bounty days later. 300 pesos and free gulaman seemed like a lot for a normal person. But not for him, he was not done at all.</p>
            <p>Hours before Calporto's assasination, he was given another offer.</p>
            <p id="quote">"1000 pesos for Rene."</p>
            <p>He accepted that offer, he was even ecstatic that he was given the chance to assasinate him.</p>
            <p>His plan was simple, bring a gun and shoot Rene Adrian Espanola, the tyrannic president of 9-Neon. Then run away and enjoy life.</p>
            <p>He had scheduled this plan for Neon's christmas party, which was in 3 months. The only time he gets to be close to Rene. </p>
            <p>3 months later, It was the Christmas party, Rene was giving a speech to his classmates about some random topic. Craig was ready to shoot him</p>
            <p style="font-weight:bold" id="quote">As the clock struck 12, he shot his shot.</p>
