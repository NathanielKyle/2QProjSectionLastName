            <p id="start">The pisay news community, TPT's development team included, is outraged as a fraudulent browser states a ridiculous claim insulting one of the community's beloved members.</p>
            <p>Only trust websites that are certified and green-flagged by the PSHS-WVC News team like this website. A PSHS-WVC certified news website is instructed to talk about news regarding the campus and would never call out another website for being "fake".</p>
            <br />
            <p id="quote">Weekly Viral Chika, owned by Justin Kirby Igual, is a Fraud.</p>
            <p>As of right now, the head of the PSHS-WVC news team, Vicente Antonio Ong, has not spoken about this concern. However, if this issue extends to a lawsuit or any legal action due to copyright or defamation, which is highly likely, we will give our full support to the side against Weekly Viral Chika and/or contribute to this case. Whatever comes in the dark will always comes to light.</p>
