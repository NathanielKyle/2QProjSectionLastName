            <p id="quote">"Physically I am in hell week, mentally i'm in Intrams season"</p>
            <p id="start">With Intrams around the corner, Pisaynons are ecstatic and are looking forward to this month despite the unfathomable amount of requirements and the 2nd Quarter Exams.</p>
            <p> One thing that everyone is anticipating in Intrams are the batch jerseys. Usually the jersey design is reveals a few days before the event. However, due to our middlemen, we are able to get leaked files of two batches' intrams jersey.</p>
            <p>Batch 2027's jersey had some slight changes after its first release in the jersey voting. Its main jersey features a cat flying up to space with stars all around it. It was made by the hardworking members of the creatives team. </p>
            <p>Their second jersey is still unknown. However, An anonymous jersey designer stated that it will feature a blue and white color scheme.</p>
            <img class="t2029 " src="../public/images/2029.png" />
            <p>Batch 2029's leaked jersey, on the other hand, features a geometrical design with a green and light green color scheme.</p>
            <p>Both batches' jerseys were met with generally positive reviews. Some people remarked 2027's starry and galactic look as a design idea that stood out of the other designs and 2029's geometric look as a simple yet elegant display.</p>
            <p>NOTE: These are not the final jersey designs and are subject to change.</p>
