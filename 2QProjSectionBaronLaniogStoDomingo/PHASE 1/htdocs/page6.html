            <h2>New Year, New Hell Week!</h2>

            <p id="quote">"WHY IS THIS BIO LG 72 PAGES"</p>
            <p id="start">There are 3 things certain in the new year as a Pisaynon, Intrams, Reqs, and THE QUARTER EXAM.</p>
            <img src="../public/images/neon.png">
            <p>Starting the next few weeks, the campus will be full of fear and sadness as multiple assignments get cramped into a single day and as the Quarter Exam approaches it. Fellow Grade 9 student Vicente Antonio Ong expresses his frustration as he approaches a day where there are 12 requirements due and where the quarter exams are in the school day after that.</p>
            <p id="quote">"It hurts my brain even thinking about that day, like theres 11 requirements, 2 days, AND A DOUBLE PERIOD STATISTICS CLASS. There couldn't be a day worse than that. Right?"</p>
            <p>However fret not, as Intrams will be directly after this hell week, and will surely be a very fun event for everyone involved. As a wise man once said, there will always be light at the end of a tunnel.</p>
